				<h3>Mercede's Dual Axis Steering</h3>
				<p>
						The device appears to change the alignment (toe) of the front wheels. It is controlled by the driver by pulling and pushing on the steering column.

				<h3>Halo</h3>
				<p>
						The halo is a driver crash-protection system used in open-wheel racing series, which consists of a curved bar placed to protect the driver's head.

				<h3>Head and Neck Support system (HANS)</h3>
				<p>
						A HANS device (head and neck support device) is a type of head restraint, a safety device in motorsports. Head restraints are mandatory when competing with most major motorsports sanctioning bodies. They reduce the likelihood of head or neck injuries, including the often fatal basilar skull fracture, in the event of a crash. There are many such devices on the market today, but the HANS is the original and the most common

				<h3>Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS)</h3>
				<p>
						A kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) is an automotive system for recovering a moving vehicle's kinetic energy under braking. The recovered energy is stored in a reservoir (for example a flywheel or high voltage batteries) for later use under acceleration. Examples include complex high end systems such as the Zytek, Flybrid, Torotrak and Xtrac used in Formula One racing and simple, easily manufactured and integrated differential based systems such as the Cambridge Passenger/Commercial Vehicle Kinetic Energy Recovery System (CPC-KERS).

				<h3>Sequential Gearbox</h3>
				<p>
						A sequential manual transmission, also known as a sequential gearbox, or a sequential transmission, is a type of non-synchronous manual transmission used mostly for motorcycles and racing cars. It produces faster shift times than traditional synchronized manual transmissions, and restricts the driver to selecting either the next or previous gear, in a successive order.

				<h3>Carbon Fibre Helmets</h3>
				<p>
						There are 17 comprehensive layers in a carbon fibre helmet. The rigid shell of carbon fibre features a high-density foam. This foam lining absorbs impact and distributes the weight. After performing a laser scan on the driver's head, the team customises the innermost layer.
